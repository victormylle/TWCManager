# SSL_CERTIFICATE_FAILED errors
# These errors began appearing and impacing the build pipeline in Jul 2021
# They occur only for the arm7 arch (which is the RPi) and only for some
# packages. Affected packages seem to be those with no wheel package for
# arm7.
#
# Things we've investigated:
# - Checked commits around the time it broke, nothing relevant
# - Public or private worker, no change
# - Changed debian to ubuntu LTS, no cbange
# - Skipped installation of cryptography package
# - Skipped impacted packages from setuptools script
